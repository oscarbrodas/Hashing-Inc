# Hashing-Inc


|| ================== Interface ================== ||

The interface to the program displays the car accident 
data based off of the longitude and latitude of the 
user's preference. The table displays the 10 most
frequent values for that sector. The two hashing buttons
in the lower left corner change the hashing functions
for the hashmaps used in data retreval and the timer
represents how much time it took to retreive a set
of data from the maps.

The entire interface was made using SDL_Library.
